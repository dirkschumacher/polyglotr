The goal of `polyglotr` is just to show how you can use three different languages through WebAssembly in an R package using [wasmr](https://github.com/dirkschumacher/wasmr).

## Example


```{r example}
library(polyglotr)
```

To be fair, the assemblyscript wasm is 6kb.

```{r}
bench::mark(
  fib_c(20),
  fib_rust(20),
  fib_assemblyscript(20)
)
```
